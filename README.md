<p> Testing System is a type of software testing that is performed on a complete integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements.

In system testing, integration testing passed components are taken as input. The goal of integration testing is to detect any irregularity between the units that are integrated together. System testing detects defects within both the integrated units and the whole system. The result of system testing is the observed behavior of a component or a system when it is tested 

Result of checking will be written in terminal. </p>
  <h2> Testing system supports:</h2>
  <ol>
  <li> checking n-tests </li>
  <li> checking </li>
  <li> new features will be available in Future(maybe) </li>
  </ol>
  <h2> Prepare testing system </h2>
  <ol>
  <li> open contest folder </li>
  <il> put test folder with anwsers and tasks in tests </li>
  <li> put contestants tests in code folder </li>
  <li> fill global.cfg with data </li>
  </ol>
  <h2> Prepare global.cfg </h2>
  <p> all statements should end with ';' </p>
  <ol>
  <li>  After "tasks=" - write number of assigments. E.g. tasks=10; </li>
  <li>  After "tests:" - write Task name and count of tests. E.g. A=3; </li>
  </ol>
  <h2> How to compile and run program: </h2>
  <ol> 
  <li> dowload archive with Testing System </li>
  <li> download Makefile and put it in directory src </li>
  <li> open terminal in src </li>
  <li> run in terminal: make </li>
  <li> run in terminal judge </li>
  </ol>
